<h1> Caitlin and Emily's Final Project </h1>

Period 1 <br>
Emily Xu and Caitlin Stanton <br>

What our product does: <br>
It is a version of the popular game, Pong. There is a two-player version and a one-player version, one of which
can be selected at the start of the game.

How to run it: <br>
At the start of the game, a screen will pop up, asking you to choose between a red pill and a blue pill.
Click on the red pill if you wish to play against another person. Click the blue pill if you wish to play
against a computer.
For the two-player version, player 1 will navigate their paddle with the W and S keys, while player 2 will
use the UP and DOWN keys.
For the one-player version, player 1 (which is the player) will navigate their paddle with the W and S keys.
Nobody will use the UP and DOWN keys, as the computer player is self-controlled.
The object of the game is to get the ball into the opposing player's goal. The first player to reach 5 points wins.
Once a winner has emerged, the end screen will display, showing the score and who won. There you have a choice: press SPACE and go back to the start screen to play another game, or press ENTER to exit the game.
Enjoy!
